Basic idea for the kernel design:

16 bit bootloader
       |
  32bit check
    /      \
no 32bit   32bit
   |          \
16bit PC     32bit or higher PC, load portion for 32bit *and up*
               |
             64bit check
             /         \
          no 64bit    64bit
             |            \
         32bit PC        64bit (or higher) PC

This could (theoretically) be used for any number of bits that x86 supports (128bit?)
