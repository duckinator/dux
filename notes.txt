1 Build 
~~~~~~~~
make cross compiler
 cd tools/cross;make;cd -

run kernel
 cd ../../;scons;./run.sh

Don't forget to read [http://wiki.github.com/RockerMONO/dux/compiling]

 export  ~/duxcc:~/duxcc/bin:~/duxincludes

Export these to your path, using zsh the command is:
 path=( ~/duxcc ~/duxcc/bin ~/duxincludes $path)
Be sure to put this in your ~/.zshenv


2 Emacs 
~~~~~~~~
Make sure your indention is set to use tabs for C mode instead of
spaces.

 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook (lambda () (setq indent-tabs-mode t)))


3 start.asm 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
First thing that needs done is setting up grub. [1] Dux loads
directly, no _grub_ chain loading. [2] Because dux is multiboot
complient [3]the very first bit of asm after declaring a few external
functions is the multiboot header. 

3.1 Multiboot complience 
=========================
    Multiboot complience means including an additional header within the
    _first_ 8192 bytes of the OS image that is [longword] aligned. The
    header layout is specified at [header layout]. Three of the fields are
    required [magic], flags, and checksum. [4] Flags is 32 bits used to
    indicate requirements to the bootloader.[5] Read up on the rest.



    [header layout]: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html#Header-layout
    [magic]: magic field

4 Terms 
~~~~~~~~
  longword: 32 bit aligned
  magic field: 0x1BADB002 used to identify the multiboot
       header. This is offset 0.

[2] Multi-boot according to duckinator is described in 
[Loading-an-operating-system-directly].

[3] [Multiboot specifiction]

[4] checksum's against the other two required flags 
`-(MAGIC + FLAGS)'

[5] Dux asks for `MODULEALIGN | MEMINFO'
