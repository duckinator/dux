Dux is an operating system started back in 2008 or so.
Some goals include being simple on both the developer and user.

About the naming:
  Dux - the operating system as a whole - this name was a suggestion from duckinator's friend
  metodo - the kernel - "method"/"approach" in Italian (and also in Esperanto, but this was learned later)
  colpa - the debugger - "fault" in Italian

The cross compiler is GCC version 4.4.0 and Binutils 2.19.1, as those are known to work on cygwin, linux, and mac.
To create the cross compiler:
cd tools/cross;make
