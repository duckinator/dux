Dux is an operating system started back in 2008 or so.

About the naming:
  Dux - the operating system as a whole - this name was a suggestion from duckinator's friend
  metodo - the kernel - "method"/"approach" in Italian (and also in Esperanto, but this was learned later)
  colpa - the debugger - "fault" in Italian

To compile dux you need:
  - clang (C compiler; version 1.0 is known to work)
  - nasm  (assembler; version 2.08.01 is known to work)
  - ld    (linker, from binutils 2.20.1 is known to work but it should work if it can link an elf binary)
