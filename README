Dux is an operating system started in 2008, and was mostly unmaintained from 2012 to 2014.

Originally a super-gross monolithic kernel, it is currently being torn apart and turned into a microkernel.

To compile dux you need:
  - clang (C compiler; version 1.0 is known to work)
  - nasm  (assembler; version 2.08.01 is known to work)
  - ld    (linker, from binutils 2.20.1 is known to work but it should work if it can link an elf binary)
